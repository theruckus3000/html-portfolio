<h1>The Best Movies According to Javier</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</h3>

<p>Funny, witty, with just the right amount of charm to have anyone laughing in their seats.</p>

<h3>Carlito's Way</h3>

<p>Classic Al Pacino doing what he does best as a gangster trying to go straight in NYC.</p>

<h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>

<p>The story telling is suberb and one of the best done on screen in recent times.</p>
